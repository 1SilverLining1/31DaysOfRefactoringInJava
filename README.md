## 31DaysOfRefactoringInJava

Most part of my job is to work on a piece of code that's already written by someone.
When I read such code, I often like to think(sometimes actually do) about changing things to make the code better. 
And I also wonder, how a piece of code I am writing today, will be changed by someone else in future. 
Coz that's what a lot of jobs demand - to be able to re-use/improve/extend code already written. 

So I thought of reading a bit about Refactoring, and upon googling, I came acorss this book called [31 Days of Refactoring by Sean Chambers, Simone Chiaretta](https://lostechies.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/31DaysRefactoring.pdf).
It is a great book - clear and concise. It has one lesson per day, but you can really finish the entire book in a day. 

The book is originally written for .net as a language. 
And hence, I took up the task of learning the lessons as given in the book - one per day. But, I also started converting them to Java. 

This repo is a **literal** translation of the book called 31 days of refactoring. 
Now, a lot of the lessons - like the 1st one - feel **very obvious** to a Java developer. 
Those who have read Effective Java might find this a waste!
But the point is not to teach Java, it's about engendering the thought of Reafctoring and what to keep in mind while doing it yourself!

I will try to add one lesson each day! 

Feel free to contribute! :D
