/*
 * The point of interest here is the BankAccount.CalculateInterest method. 
 * A hint that you need the Move Method refactoring is when another class is using a method more often then the class in which it lives. 
 * If this is the case it makes sense to move the method to the class where it is primarily used.
 * This doesnâ€™t work in every instance because of dependencies, but it is overlooked often as a worthwhile change.
